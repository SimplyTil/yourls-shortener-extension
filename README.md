# Chrome Extension for YOURLS

[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

A Chrome extension for interacting with your [YOURLS](http://yourls.org/) (Your Own URL Shortener) instance.

## Setup Instructions

### Installation
1. Download the extension from the Chrome Web Store or install it manually by loading the unpacked extension in developer mode
2. Click on the extension icon and select "Options" (or right-click the icon and choose "Options")

### Configuration
In the options page, you'll need to configure the following settings:

- **API URL**: Enter the base URL of your YOURLS installation
  - Format: `https://your-domain.com/yourls` or `http://your-domain.com/path-to-yourls`
  - Do NOT include `yourls-api.php` at the end - the extension handles this automatically
  - Make sure to include the correct protocol (http:// or https://)

- **Signature Token**: Enter your personal signature token
  - This can be found in your YOURLS admin dashboard under "Tools" â†’ "API"
  - Using a signature token is more secure than using your admin credentials

- **Request Timeout**: Set the maximum wait time (in seconds)
  - Recommended: 5-10 seconds for most environments
  - If you have a slow server connection, you may need to increase this value

- **Keyword Prompt**: Toggle whether to prompt for custom keywords
  - When enabled: You'll be asked to provide a custom keyword each time you shorten a URL
  - When disabled: URLs will be shortened immediately using YOURLS' automatic keyword generation

### Saving Your Settings
After configuring all options, click the "Save" button. A confirmation message will appear when your settings are successfully saved.

To verify your configuration, try shortening a URL using the extension - if successful, you'll receive a shortened URL in response.

## Usage

The extension provides two different ways for interaction:

### Toolbar Icon

Click on the YOURLS extension icon in your browser toolbar to shorten the URL of the current tab. If you have enabled the "Ask for a keyword" option, you'll see a popup allowing you to enter a custom keyword for your shortened URL.

After processing, the extension will display the shortened URL which you can copy to your clipboard.

### Context Menu Option

Right-click on any link on a webpage to access the context menu, then select "Shorten with YOURLS" to create a shortened version of that specific link without navigating to it first.

If the "Ask for a keyword" option is enabled, you'll be prompted to enter a custom keyword before shortening.

## Features

- Quickly shorten the current page URL
- Shorten specific links via context menu
- Optional custom keywords for your shortened URLs
- Copy shortened URLs to clipboard with a single click
